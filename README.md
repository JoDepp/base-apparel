## My process

Build HTML, CSS , JSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript



### What I learned

A little big of everything. I mostly learned that I need to come up with my own way of setting up my projects and websites because there are so many ways and mix them all together doesn't work. 

### Continued development
I will head over to JS land and work on learning more JavaScript. 
There are still many issues with this but I'm going to move on for now. 

### Useful resources
I used sooo many resources. 
https://www.w3schools.com/ is my go to resource
Also, looking at other peoples solutions however they are all so differnent it is almost not helpful. 
@Prince on Frontend Mentor, his solution was the best out of the dozen+ I looked at.
